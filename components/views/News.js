  <h2>Movie Genres</h2>

  <p>
    For film studies, the book defines genre as a category or classification of
    a group of movies in which the individual films share similar subject matter
    and similar ways of organizing the subject through narrative and stylistic
    patterns. Additionally it can also function as cultural rituals in which
    rituals are both formal and ideological practices that can become a
    beneficial means of responding a variety of situations. Genres have been
    used to classify various art forms well before the creation of films. For
    literature, Tragedy was considered the most important in Aristotle's
    Poetics, Musical genres were composed of classical sonatas and symphonies,
    and genre painting depicting domestic life and daily social encounters began
    to surface in the 17th century and were then followed by genre painting that
    came to suggest an image of a "slice of life. Ultimately these genres were
    linked to the stage, and the most popular genre of the 19th century
    melodrama was formed. Through the creation of these different forms, three
    function began to tae shape: to provide models for producing other works, to
    direct audience expectations, to create categories for judging or evaluating
    a work. From the beginning, cinema has employed the genre system, but the
    rise of the Studio System in the 1920's and 30's basically opened the door
    for movie genres. It adapted an industrial mass production format, which
    allowed for movie producers to reuse script formulas, actors, sets, etc. to
    create modified version of the same popular film. The Studio System soon saw
    its decline in with the Paramount decision of 1948, where the Supreme Court
    rules that the major studios violated antitrust laws by also owning movie
    theaters, which allowed them to monopolize the film business. As time
    passed, a new era known as New Hollywood began to emerge. Film school
    educated directors began drawing on established genres, special effects and
    large advertising to create blockbusters.

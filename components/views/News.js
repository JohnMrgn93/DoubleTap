  <h2>Movie Genres</h2>

  <p>
    For film studies, the book defines genre as a category or classification of
    a group of movies in which the individual films share similar subject matter
    and similar ways of organizing the subject through narrative and stylistic
    patterns. Additionally it can also function as cultural rituals in which
    rituals are both formal and ideological practices that can become a
    beneficial means of responding a variety of situations. Genres have been
    used to classify various art forms well before the creation of films. For
    literature, Tragedy was considered the most important in Aristotle's
    Poetics, Musical genres were composed of classical sonatas and symphonies,
    and genre painting depicting domestic life and daily social encounters began
    to surface in the 17th century and were then followed by genre painting that
    came to suggest an image of a "slice of life. Ultimately these genres were
    linked to the stage, and the most popular genre of the 19th century
    melodrama was formed. Through the creation of these different forms, three
    function began to tae shape: to provide models for producing other works, to
    direct audience expectations, to create categories for judging or evaluating
    a work. From the beginning, cinema has employed the genre system, but the
    rise of the Studio System in the 1920's and 30's basically opened the door
    for movie genres. It adapted an industrial mass production format, which
    allowed for movie producers to reuse script formulas, actors, sets, etc. to
    create modified version of the same popular film. The Studio System soon saw
    its decline in with the Paramount decision of 1948, where the Supreme Court
    rules that the major studios violated antitrust laws by also owning movie
    theaters, which allowed them to monopolize the film business. As time
    passed, a new era known as New Hollywood began to emerge. Film school
    educated directors began drawing on established genres, special effects and
    large advertising to create blockbusters.

  <h2>Action</h2>
  <p id="Stuff">
    Action Films: This major genre type includes films that have tremendous
    impact, continuous high energy, lots of physical stunts and activity,
    possibly extended chase scenes, races, rescues, battles, martial arts,
    mountains and mountaineering, destructive disasters (floods, explosions,
    natural disasters, fires, etc.), fights, escapes, non-stop motion,
    spectacular rhythm and pacing, and adventurous heroes - all designed for
    pure audience escapism with the action sequences at the core of the film.
    Action films and adventure films have tremendous cross-over potential as
    film genres, and road films often overlap with action films. (See the
    adventure film genre listings for examples of these action/adventure
    pictures.) Both types of films come in a variety of forms or genre-hybrids:
    sci-fi or space, thrillers, crime-drama, war, horror, westerns, etc.
    Oftentimes, action films are great box-office hits, but lack critical appeal
    because of their two-dimensional heroes or villains. The main action centers
    around a male action hero or protagonist - portrayed by these most prominent
    actors: Bruce Lee, Steven Seagal, Sylvester Stallone, Harrison Ford, Bruce
    Willis, Chuck Norris, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Douglas Fairbanks Sr., Bruce
    Lee, Charles Bronson, Steve McQueen, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Chuck Norris, and
    Jean Claude Van Damme. Women in action-films usually play the roles of
    accomplices or romantic interests of the hero, although modern action films
    have featured strong female characters to broaden demographic appeal. They
    almost always have a resourceful hero(ine) struggling against incredible
    odds, life-threatening circumstances, or an evil villain, and/or trapped or
    chasing each other in various modes of transportation (bus, auto, ship,
    train, plane, horseback, on foot, etc.), with victory or resolution attained
    by the end after strenuous physical feats and violence (fist fights,
    gunplay). Action films have traditionally been aimed at male audiences, ages
    13 to the mid-30s in both American and world-wide markets.
  </p>

  <h2>Adventure</h2>
  <p id="Stuff">
    Adventure Films are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic
    locales. Adventure films are very similar to the action film genre, in that
    they are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the
    film viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting
    that is found in action films, however, the viewer of adventure films can
    live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of
    empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual
    historical figures or protagonists. Adventure films were intended to appeal
    mainly to men, creating major male heroic stars through the years. These
    courageous, patriotic, or altruistic heroes often fought for their beliefs,
    struggled for freedom, or overcame injustice. Modern adventure films, some
    of which have been successful blockbusters, have crossed over and added
    resourceful action heroes (and oftentimes heroines). Under the category of
    adventure films, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films,
    and historical spectacles (similar to the epics film genre), searches or
    expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts
    and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown.
    Adventure films are often set in an historical period, and may include
    adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes (Robin Hood,
    Tarzan, and Zorro for example), kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.
    Adventure films share many elements with other genres - there are numerous
    examples of sci-fi, fantasy, and war films with characteristics of this
    genre. Adventure films, in a broader context, could include boxing movies,
    motor racing films, and films adapted from literary novels (i.e., King
    Solomon's Mines (1937 and 1950), The Thief of Bagdad (1924 and 1940), The
    Three Musketeers (1916, 1921, 1933, 1935, 1948, 1973, and 1993), and The
    Prisoner of Zenda (1937, 1952)).

  <h2>Animated</h2>
  <p id="Stuff">
    Animated Films are ones in which individual drawings, paintings, or
    illustrations are photographed frame by frame (stop-frame cinematography).
    Usually, each frame differs slightly from the one preceding it, giving the
    illusion of movement when frames are projected in rapid succession at 24
    frames per second. The earliest cinema animation was composed of
    frame-by-frame, hand-drawn images. When combined with movement, the
    illustrator's two-dimensional static art came alive and created pure and
    imaginative cinematic images - animals and other inanimate objects could
    become evil villains or heroes.
  </p>

  <h2>Comedy</h2>
  <p id="Stuff">
    Comedy Films are "make 'em laugh" films designed to elicit laughter from the
    audience. Comedies are light-hearted dramas, crafted to amuse, entertain,
    and provoke enjoyment. The comedy genre humorously exaggerates the
    situation, the language, action, and characters. Comedies observe the
    deficiencies, foibles, and frustrations of life, providing merriment and a
    momentary escape from day-to-day life. They usually have happy endings,
    although the humor may have a serious or pessimistic side.
  </p>

  <h2>Drama</h2>
  <p id="Stuff">
    Drama Films are serious presentations or stories with settings or life
    situations that portray realistic characters in conflict with either
    themselves, others, or forces of nature. A dramatic film shows us human
    beings at their best, their worst, and everything in-between. Each of the
    types of subject-matter themes have various kinds of dramatic plots.
    Dramatic films are probably the largest film genre because they include a
    broad spectrum of films. See also crime films, courtroom dramas, melodramas,
    epics (historical dramas), biopics (biographical), or romantic genres - just
    some of the other genres that have developed from the dramatic genre.
    Dramatic themes often include current issues, societal ills, and problems,
    concerns or injustices, such as racial prejudice, religious intolerance
    (such as anti-Semitism), drug addiction, poverty, political unrest, the
    corruption of power, alcoholism, class divisions, sexual inequality, mental
    illness, corrupt societal institutions, violence toward women or other
    explosive issues of the times. These films have successfully drawn attention
    to the issues by taking advantage of the topical interest of the subject.
    Although dramatic films have often dealt frankly and realistically with
    social problems, the tendency has been for Hollywood, especially during
    earlier times of censorship, to exonerate society and institutions and to
    blame problems on an individual, who more often than not, would be punished
    for his/her transgressions.
  </p>

  <h2>Documentary</h2>
  <p id="Stuff">
    Documentary Films strictly speaking, are non-fictional, "slice of life"
    factual works of art - and sometimes known as cinema verite. For many years,
    as films became more narrative-based, documentaries branched out and took
    many forms since their early beginnings - some of which have been termed
    propagandistic or non-objective.
  </p>

  <h2>Fantasy</h2>
  <p id="Stuff">
    Fantasy Films: Unlike science fiction films that base their content upon
    some degree of scientific truth, take the audience to netherworld,
    fairy-tale places where events are unlikely to occur in real life. In
    mythological or legendary times, they transcend the bounds of human
    possibility and physical laws. Fantasy films are often in the context of the
    imagination, dreams, or hallucinations of a character or within the
    projected vision of the storyteller. Fantasy films often have an element of
    magic, myth, wonder, escapism, and the extraordinary. They may appeal to
    both children and adults, depending upon the particular film
  </p>

  <h2>Horror</h2>
  <p id="Stuff">
    Horror Films are unsettling films designed to frighten and panic, cause
    dread and alarm, and to invoke our hidden worst fears, often in a
    terrifying, shocking finale, while captivating and entertaining us at the
    same time in a cathartic experience. Horror films effectively center on the
    dark side of life, the forbidden, and strange and alarming events. They deal
    with our most primal nature and its fears: our nightmares, our
    vulnerability, our alienation, our revulsions, our terror of the unknown,
    our fear of death and dismemberment, loss of identity, or fear of sexuality.
    Whatever dark, primitive, and revolting traits that simultaneously attract
    and repel us are featured in the horror genre. Horror films are often
    combined with science fiction when the menace or monster is related to a
    corruption of technology, or when Earth is threatened by aliens. The fantasy
    and supernatural film genres are not synonymous with the horror genre,
    although thriller films may have some relation when they focus on the
    revolting and horrible acts of the killer/madman. Horror films are also
    known as chillers, scary movies, spookfests, and the macabre.
  </p>

  <h2>Musical</h2>
  <p id="Stuff">
    Musicals / Dance Films are cinematic forms that emphasize and showcase
    full-scale song and dance routines in a significant way (usually with a
    musical or dance performance as part of the film narrative, or as an
    unrealistic "eruption" within the film). Or they are films that are centered
    on combinations of music, dance, song or choreography. In traditional
    musicals, cast members are ones who sing. Musicals highlight various musical
    artists or dancing stars, with lyrics that support the story line, often
    with an alternative, escapist vision of reality - a search for love,
    success, wealth, and popularity. This genre has been considered the most
    escapist of all major film genres. Tremendous film choreography and
    orchestration often enhances musical numbers.
  </p>

  <h2>Science Fiction</h2>

  <p id="Stuff">
    Science Fiction Films are usually scientific, visionary, comic-strip-like,
    and imaginative, and usually visualized through fanciful, imaginative
    settings, expert film production design, advanced technology gadgets, robots
    and spaceships, scientific developments, or by fantastic special effects.
    Sci-fi films are complete with heroes, distant planets, impossible quests,
    improbable settings, fantastic places, great dark and shadowy villains,
    futuristic technology and gizmos, and unknown and inexplicable forces. Many
    other SF films feature time travels or fantastic journeys, and are set
    either on Earth, into outer space, or most often into the future time. Quite
    a few examples of science-fiction cinema owe their origins to writers Jules
    Verne and H.G. Wells. They often portray the dangerous and sinister nature
    of knowledge ('there are some things Man is not meant to know') (i.e., the
    classic Frankenstein (1931), The Island of Lost Souls (1933), and David
    Cronenberg's The Fly (1986) - an updating of the 1958 version directed by
    Kurt Neumann and starring Vincent Price), and vital issues about the nature
    of mankind and our place in the whole scheme of things, including the
    threatening, existential loss of personal individuality (i.e., Invasion of
    the Body Snatchers (1956), and The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957)). Plots
    of space-related conspiracies (Capricorn One (1977)), supercomputers
    threatening impregnation (Demon Seed (1977)), the results of germ-warfare
    (The Omega Man (1971)) and laboratory-bred viruses or plagues (28 Days Later
    (2002)), black-hole exploration (Event Horizon (1997)), and futuristic
    genetic engineering and cloning (Gattaca (1997) and Michael Bay's The Island
    (2005)) show the tremendous range that science-fiction can delve into.
    Strange and extraordinary microscopic organisms or giant, mutant monsters
    ('things or creatures from space') may be unleashed, either created by
    misguided mad scientists or by nuclear havoc (i.e., The Beast From 20,000
    Fathoms (1953)). Sci-fi tales have a prophetic nature (they often attempt to
    figure out or depict the future) and are often set in a speculative future
    time. They may provide a grim outlook, portraying a dystopic view of the
    world that appears grim, decayed and un-nerving (i.e., Metropolis (1927)
    with its underground slave population and view of the effects of
    industrialization, the portrayal of 'Big Brother' society in 1984 (1956 and
    1984), nuclear annihilation in a post-apocalyptic world in On the Beach
    (1959), Douglas Trumbull's vision of eco-disaster in Silent Running (1972),
    Michael Crichton's Westworld (1973) with androids malfunctioning, Soylent
    Green (1973) with its famous quote: "Soylent Green IS PEOPLE!", 'perfect'
    suburbanite wives in The Stepford Wives (1975), and the popular gladiatorial
    sport of the year 2018 in Rollerball (1975)). Commonly, sci-fi films express
    society's anxiety about technology and how to forecast and control the
    impact of technological and environmental change on contemporary society.
  </p>
  <h2>Thriller</h2>
  <p id="Stuff">
    Thriller and Suspense Films: These are types of films known to promote
    intense excitement, suspense, a high level of anticipation, ultra-heightened
    expectation, uncertainty, anxiety, and nerve-wracking tension. Thriller and
    suspense films are virtually synonymous and interchangeable categorizations,
    with similar characteristics and features. If the genre is to be defined
    strictly, a genuine thriller is a film that rentlessly pursues a
    single-minded goal - to provide thrills and keep the audience cliff-hanging
    at the 'edge of their seats' as the plot builds towards a climax. The
    tension usually arises when the main character(s) is placed in a menacing
    situation or mystery, or an escape or dangerous mission from which escape
    seems impossible. Life itself is threatened, usually because the principal
    character is unsuspecting or unknowingly involved in a dangerous or
    potentially deadly situation. Plots of thrillers involve characters which
    come into conflict with each other or with outside forces - the menace is
    sometimes abstract or shadowy.
